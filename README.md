# K-Means-Clustering-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning-Algorithm-project
Python Machine Learning (ML) project using K-Means clustering on the UCI Bank Marketing dataset and image clustering

# Project Outline:
•	Data Preprocessing (get_dummies, StandardScaler),
•	K-Means Clustering used on the bank dataset),
•	K-Means Clustering used on an image, 
•	Model evaluation and visualization with “elbow” curve
# Goals:
 It includes
•	Python (Jupyter Notebook)
•	Data preprocessing,
•	Data clustering
•	Model evaluation
•	Visualization dataset
# Data Files:
Dataset downloaded from
•	https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank%2Bmarketing?utm_source=chatgpt.com , UCI bank marketing dataset.                                                                                             License: CC BY 4.0

# Tools used: 
•	Python (Jupyter Notebook),
•	NumPy,
•	Pandas,
•	Matplotlib,
•	K-Means clustering
Results:
•	Bank dataset: Maximum clusters under “elbow” method was obtained at k = 6 
•	Image dataset: Show image clustering process
